# Vector database


This repository contains example code for using Redis Stack's vector similarity search. You can use Redis Stack's query and search capabilities to:

* Index vectors
* Find similar vectors

The Redis commands are wrapped by using a `VectorDB` class.


## Examples

* [Use vector similarity search to build a recommendation engine](./examples/vss-rec/)
* [Find similar texts within the database](./examples/vss-text)
